# Nonlinear-Causal-Discovery-in-Acyclic-Model-with-Mutiple-Latent-Confounders
## Kind Tips
This is a repo we are building. 
We proposed a practial tool called **NonlinearMLC** for causal discovery in (nonlinear) causal additive models (CAM) with multiple latent confounders. We will provide an example to demonstrate the flow of the method and supplements of our experiments related to the paper, if time permits. (We hope that we will upload them soon.)
